## Operations

The `operations` property defines which operations the account should be able to do.

The value that this property receives is a hexadecimal string, where each bit represents a contract.



Ex:

"01af" is the hexadecimal to 000110101111.

The 1's represent the contracts it should be able to do (following [this table](undefined))

This account will be able to do contracts of type 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 (Transfer, Create Asset, Create Validator, Config Validator, Unfreeze, Undelegate, Withdraw).

After getting the hexadecimal string, you need to invert the byte order, for proper processing in the blockchain.

you can use either of the following JS code to do so:

```javascript
utils.parseAccountPermissionBinaryOperations("000110101111")

utils.reverseHexBytes("01af")
```

Both return the same "af01" which is the correct value for said operations.
