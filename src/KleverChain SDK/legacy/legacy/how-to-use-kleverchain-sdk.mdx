# Basic usage

There are _two ways t_o make a contract call: you can call only one method passing the user data plus the contract data or you can create an instance of an account.

> Sender address and private key is required in all transactions.

With a simple call:

```typescript
import { sendTransaction, TransactionType } from "@klever/sdk";

const transactionType = TransactionType.Transfer;
const transactionPayload = {
  sender: "address",
  privateKey: "privateKey",
  receiver: "receiver",
  amount: 100,
};

sendTransaction(transactionType, transactionPayload);
```

With an account instance:

```typescript
import { Account } from "@klever/sdk";

const account = new Account("address", "privateKey");
const transactionPayload = {
  receiver: "receiver",
  amount: 100,
};

account.sendTransfer(transactionPayload);
```

## Usage Inside a Context

If you want a global instance of your account to use throughout your app, you can create a custom hook to help you with that.

Using React as an example, you can create a `MyCustomHook.tsx` file and create your provider as follows:

```tsx
import { useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react';
import { Account, core } from '@klever/sdk';

interface ISdkContext {
  isLoaded(): Promise<boolean>;
  getAccount(): Account | null;
  setAccount(account: Account): void;
}

const SdkContext = createContext({} as ISdkContext);

const SdkProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [acc, setAcc] = useState<Account | null>(null);

  const values: ISdkContext = {
    isLoaded: () => core.isSDKLoaded(),
    getAccount: () => acc,
    setAccount: account => setAcc(account),
  };
  return <SdkContext.Provider value={values}>{children}</SdkContext.Provider>;
};

const useSdk = () => useContext(SdkContext);

export { SdkContext, SdkProvider, useSdk };
```

And wrap your entire `App.tsx` in it:

```typescript
import { SdkProvider } from './MyCustomHook';
...
  <SdkProvider>
    ...
  </SdkProvider>
...
```

With that, you can use it on any child component you want, without the need to instantiate an account every time:

```typescript
import { useSdk } from './MyCustomHook';
...
const sdk = useSdk();
const account = sdk.getAccount();
...
await account.sendTransfer(payload)
...
```

The same pattern of global provider can be achieved in any framework you want, not only React.
