# Slot

A **slot** is the minimum time delay between each block, before an elected Masternode proposes a new block. The initial slot time is 4** seconds** and can be updated by a network proposal.

# Epoch

**Epochs** are sets of slots defined by a fixed time; each epoch lasts **6 hours**. This parameter can also be upgraded by a network proposal. At the end of each epoch, a new set of masternodes will be selected as the next Epoch validators.

## Masternodes

When an epoch starts, initially **21 masternodes** (this number can be changed by network proposal)  are randomly chosen to be the validators for that epoch according to the previous hash. A masternode can be chosen to be a validator more than 2 times in a row.
