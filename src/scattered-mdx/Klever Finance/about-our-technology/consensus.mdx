## Proof of Stake

Entities, companies or individuals are chosen as **validators** on the Klever Blockchain, with the task of verifying transactions and mining blocks based on the amount of assets they hold. A user must provide some proof of holding a certain minimum amount of KLV in order to be promoted to validator, and to be able to operate as a Masternode.

## Masternode

A Masternode is essentially a full node on the network that receives incentives and rewards to operate and perform actions on the blockchain. As the Masternode status is obtained by KLV staking, a Masternode owner also participates in the **KLV staking pool** and there will be a limit of **500 eligible Masternodes seats**, which can all compete for a spot among the **top 21 block producers**.

### Pratical Byzantine Fault Tolerance ( PBFT )

The PBFT algorithm consists of a three-phased protocol: **Pre-Prepare, Prepare**, and **Commit**. Together, they form the core of the PBFT consensus algorithm.


**Pre-Prepare:** The primary node is responsible for verifying the requests and generating corresponding pre-prepare messages. Then, the Primary node will broadcast pre-prepare messages to all Replica nodes. After receiving the messages, Replica nodes will verify the legitimacy of those pre-prepare messages and then broadcast a corresponding prepare message.
**Prepare:** Gathering prepare messages. After a certain node gathers 2f+1 prepare messages, it will announce that it is ready for block submission and start to broadcast commit messages;
**Commit:** Gathering commit messages. After a certain node gathers 2f+1 commit messages, it will process the native requests cached locally and make corresponding changes to the system state.

**f** is the number of nodes in the consensus.
