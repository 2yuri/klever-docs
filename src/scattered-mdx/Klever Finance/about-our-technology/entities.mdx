## Accounts

Each **account** has a pair of keys, **one private and one public**, that are used to control and represent the account respectively. The private key holder of an account can sign transactions to the network.

The **public key is a 65-byte-long piece of information** derived from the private key by an elliptic curve. The public key information can be encoded using the** Bech32 human-readable representation format** in order to create the Account Address. **Klever’s Bech32 HRP is **`klv`.

An account holds information on the amount of **KLV** (Klever network main asset), **KFI** (Klever finance governance asset) and any other token deployed on Klever’s blockchain. A mapping storage is also associated with any Klever Account which can hold any binary value.


## Nodes

**Nodes** are devices connected to the network. They are responsible for maintaining historical data and performing actions on users requests. Every node is uniquely identified by its **96-byte-long BLS public key** which allows the network to rate and reward each individual based on its contribution. To be an active entity, a node must upgrade to a **Masternode**.To upgrade to a Masternode, an account must stake a substantial amount of KLV as collateral.
