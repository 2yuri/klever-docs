**KLV is the main utility token of the Klever Blockchain.**

Klever Swap  uses KLV as its **fee engine**. All users can either reduce their swap fees by **holding KLV** in their wallet or pay fees in KLV thereby receiving lower costs for fees. Additionally, any fee paid on Swap using other coins or tokens is instantly converted to KLV by buying off the market, adding to KLVâ€™s liquidity and usability.
