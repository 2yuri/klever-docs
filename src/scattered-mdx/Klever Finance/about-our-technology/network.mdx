A network is a group of interconnected devices that exchange information. These devices can be connected locally by a cable or wirelessly through the internet. In Klever blockchain, we use a distributed  type of network called peer-to-peer.



## P2P Protocol

In our protocol there are two ways to send data to the other peers:

1.  Broadcasting message on a pubsub using topics;

2 . Sending direct messages to the connected peers.


The first type is used to send messages that have to reach every node (from the corresponding shard, metachain, consensus group, etc.) and the second type is used to resolve requests coming from directly-connected peers.
The Messenger interface with its implementation is used to define the way to communicate between the nodes.
