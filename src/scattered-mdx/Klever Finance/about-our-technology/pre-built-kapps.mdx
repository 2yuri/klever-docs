KleverChain will offer pre-built and ready-to-use apps and functionalities native to the blockchain, not merely a smart contracts platform.

In a smart contract blockchain platform, developers need to code a smart contract for all their blockchain applications and features, including something as simple as creating a token. This means that as a builder of dapps without smart contract experience, you have to rely on and trust the person or team that has developed the smart contract itself and simply hope that nothing vulnerable or malicious is hidden in the smart contract.

Unlike other blockchain protocols and foundations, Klever Finance will work directly with developers and projects - providing full blockchain integration for them and building the functionalities they want and need in the protocol.

This approach of utilizing ready-built Kapps for all developers to use results in blockchain applications that are safer by design since they are native to the blockchain as well as easy to use for the developers - the process will just be a function call, not a complex and often vulnerable smart contract.

Developers will be able to implement their own interface solution through the easy-to-use, intuitive, and versatile KleverOS Software Development Kit (SDK). Using the innovation of the KleverOS SDK, the functionalities of the Kapps deployed to KleverChain will constantly evolve. Klever Finance will be deploying new versions with improvements to the Kapps that do not block or inhibit the use of previous versions.
