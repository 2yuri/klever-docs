## How to become a Masternode?

To become a masternode, a user must apply as a candidate.  A fee of **50,000 KLV** will be charged and burned in the masternode application processes. The masternode candidate on Klever Finance Blockchain must hold a minimum of **1,500,000 KLV in self-staking **to be considered** active**. To become an **eligible** masternode for the consensus and produce blocks,  the node must reach the threshold of **10,000,000 KLV** through self-staking plus delegated-staking. The masternode owner can also specify if it will allow delegated-staking and its delegation cap.


- If for any reason the masternode delegation goes below the threshold, the masternode becomes inactive and will be added to the waiting list until the threshold is reached again.
- If a node doesn't have a minimum of 1,5M KLV in self-staking, it will not participate in any staking or earns
- The minimum self-staking  of 1,500,000 KLV can only be retrieved if the masternode cancels the application and there is no delegation-stake in process
- The 1,5M self-staked KLV will be blocked and only available if the owner decides to destroy the masternode
- If a master node is below 10M KLV staking, it will not be a producer, but it will be allowed to participate in the staking pool
- A masternode can choose to have an open or closed delegated pool as well to cap the max amount of delegated votes
- The delegation cap can be increased at any time, but only reduced to the current staked amount.
- Masternodes can set a commission fee for the delegated staking on their node (if the pool is open)

## Masternode Rewards

Masternodes earn block confirmation rewards when transactions are confirmed by their blockchain nodes. The block reward flowback is set initially to **50% of fee paid by users**. The additional **50% of fees will be burned to control inflation** and maintain a healthy network interoperability. An additional amount of **15 KLV will be added to the block rewards**. Both the fees and the block rewards will be distributed **proportionally to the staked amount** of each wallet.
All staked amounts bound to masternodes (eligible or not) will participate in a **rewards pool of 500,000 KLV** daily, proportional to the staked amount of each wallet.

- Masternode owners can set a commission fee for the delegated-staking on their node.
- All rewards are added to a claimable balance in the wallet and must be claimed by the wallet owner to be made available.
- All parameters can be adjusted by on-chain proposals
- All rewards are claimable and must be claimed by the owner wallet
- 50% of the fees are burnt and 50% are distributed to the masternodes that produced blocks

## Developer Rewards (K-APPS)

When creating an application on the blockchain, the developer can use their **developer code**(Referral code) within their k-app transactions to receive rewards (each k-app will have a percentage of the transaction fee). The reward will be paid in the currency in which the kApp transaction is provided.
