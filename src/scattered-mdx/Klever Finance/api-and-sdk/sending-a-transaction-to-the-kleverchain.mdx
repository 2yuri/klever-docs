If you plan on using the raw endpoints, you'll need to do three main steps: building, signing and broadcasting the transaction.

## 1. Build

To build the transaction, if you are creating a web application, you can use the window method injected by the Klever extension (or the Klever 5 mobile browser).

```typescript
const unsignedTransaction = await window.kleverWeb.buildTransaction([
      {
        payload,
        type: TransactionType.Transfer,
      },
]);
```

Even though you can use the window kleverWeb object directly, we suggest you [use the Kleverchain JS SDK,](https://klever.gitbook.io/kleverchain-sdk/) if you are using javascript.


Alternatively you can send the params [through the `send` endpoint](https://node.mainnet.klever.finance/swagger/index.html#/Transaction/post_transaction_send), and will receive an unsigned transaction as response.

## 2. Sign

To sign the transaction, if you are creating a web application, again, you can use the window method injected by the Klever extension (or the Klever 5 mobile browser).

```typescript
const signedTransaction = await window.kleverWeb.signTransaction(unsignedTransaction);
```



Alternatively, to sign the transaction, you will need to do it using a backend application, so you don't expose your private key. For instance, you can [use the GO SDK](https://github.com/klever-io/klever-go-sdk) or [the Kleverchain JS SDK](https://klever.gitbook.io/kleverchain-sdk/) with NodeJS.

## 3. Broadcast

To broadcast the transaction, if you are creating a web application, again, you can use the window method.

```typescript
const broadcastResponse = await window.kleverWeb.broadcastTransactions([signedTransaction]);
```

Alternatively you can send a signed transaction [through the `broadcast` endpoint](https://node.mainnet.klever.finance/swagger/index.html#/Transaction/post_transaction_broadcast) to be processed and validated by the blockchain.
