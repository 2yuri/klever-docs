The first step to integrating an exchange with our KleverChain is connecting to its network by deploying a KleverChain node.

Running a node will provide a faster and more reliable access to all the chain updates as well as broadcasting transactions onto the blockchain. You can use a third-party node to interact with the blockchain, however.

Refer to [this How to run a node section](undefined) to get started with the node deployment.
