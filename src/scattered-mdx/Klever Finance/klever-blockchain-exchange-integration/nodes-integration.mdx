To interact with Klever's blockchain, reading, fetching and uploading data, we provide a set of API calls.

There you can find their documentation pages:

[KleverChain Proxy API](https://api.mainnet.klever.finance/swagger/index.html)

[KleverChain Node API](https://node.mainnet.klever.finance/swagger/index.html)

## Custom integration

### Generate Addresses

To generate addresses, you may refer to [How to create a wallet session](undefined).

### Transfer Assets

To create transactions, you can [use the endpoints directly](undefined), or [use the KleverChain SDK](https://klever.gitbook.io/kleverchain-sdk/how-to-use-kleverchain-sdk) (if using javascript).

### Read transactions

To read the recent transactions, you'll need to [use the transaction list endpoint](https://api.mainnet.klever.finance/swagger/index.html#/Transaction/get_v1_0_transaction_list), and use the queries that are relevant for your search(Ex: filter by asset, date, receiver/sender address, etc.)
