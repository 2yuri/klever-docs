We recommend testing both on testnet, and then on mainnet nodes, before launching and app.

Throughout all the stages of development, you can use the testnet to test the logic of your application and the integration with the chain. The main advantage is that in the testnet you can request test KLV for free.

The mainnet is where the application will be actually running, so it is recommended to test the flow in the production environment as well.
