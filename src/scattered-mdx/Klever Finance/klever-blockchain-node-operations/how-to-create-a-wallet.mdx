To create a wallet, choosing the output folder, first create the output folder and then run the operator with `create-wallet` command:

```bash
mkdir wallet
```

```bash
docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd)/wallet:/opt/klever-blockchain \
    --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/operator \
    kleverapp/klever-go:latest account create
```

This will generate the wallet and return the address asociated with it, as seen below:

If the output directory does not exist, it will be created but you may run into file permission issues.

To check your wallet certificate and address, type:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd)/wallet:/opt/klever-blockchain \
    --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/operator \
    kleverapp/klever-go:latest account address
```

This should show your address, as seen below:
