_Blockchain is difficult, but it shouldn't be._

### 1. What is Klever

Klever Finance is a trusted **permissionless **blockchain network for the emerging decentralized economy, providing **a safer, faster and smarter cryptocurrency experience** for all users globally to enter and thrive.

A blockchain network does not have an intrinsic value in and of itself, but in fact is only as valuable as what the platform offers its users in terms of usable products and opportunities to participate in the network.

With this in mind, we present **KleverChain** to allow users on a global scale to access indispensable services and products. These include market-leading **crypto wallet**, **crypto swap**, **web browser**, **exchange**, **staking**, **payment channels**, **loans**, **liquidity pools**, **decentralized finance**, **game assets**, **supply chains**, **logistic records**, **notary**, **stored value**, **gift cards**, **rewards**, **loyalty programs**, **collectibles**, **banking**, **ownership **and more.

We strive to create a network where trustless technologies empower businesses and individuals in an open global economy using secure, fast and innovative on-chain peer-to-peer applications.


### 2. **Architecture Overview**

Building and deploying blockchain apps should be **simple**, **cheap**, and **easy** for all developers to do, and that is exactly what Klever Blockchain enables.

Instead of being a smart-contracts platform, Klever Blockchain will provide **prebuilt and ready-to-use functionalities for developers to build decentralized applications.**

Our goal is to have a secure and efficient blockchain coordinated by a **Proof of Stake** consensus mechanism composed of **21 validators**, which are randomly selected among the masternodes for the consensus group in each Epoch.

Nodes will sign-off messages broadcasted to the network building a reliability rank of each operator. Nodes with bad behavior will be jailed. Until this jail time isnâ€™t cleared, those ill-behaved nodes will not participate in the validators selection pool.

On top of that, a customized version of the **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm (PBFT)** was implemented for network reliability and resilience, ensuring a fast full confirmation of blocks.
